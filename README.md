Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.17.1+
Must use the Vault plugin for economy

Allows the player to buy and sell items with an easy-to-use GUI

This project is working but rather incomplete. You can only change prices by changing config. The plugin resources are reloaded every time
the user opens /sell or /shop

No longer supported.
